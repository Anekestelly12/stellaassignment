<br> All glory to God Almighty for all he has done because without him i will not have been able to acheive anything<br>
<br> i went to nusery school and came out in flying colours above all my class mate and afterwards proceeded to primary<br>
<br> school though the journey through out the way was not that easy but at the last i obtained my primary school <br>
<br> certificate </p>
<p> i went to omobola secondary school and finally graduated with good grades <br>
<p> afterwards i proceeded to run a program called IJMBE (interim joint matriculation board examination)<br>
<br> i could remember when i started the programme everything seemed to be very hard but after some time with the lectures<br>
<br> and some help from friends and the lecturers and the entire management it became easy and after our mock examination<br>
<br> i was encouraged to study more and after the final examination i came out as one of the best student </p>
<p> At the time i was waiting for admission i decided to go into fashion designing and i can now design clothes perfectly<br>
<p> finally i gained admission into the university of my choice to study my dream course library and information science<br>
<br> also i still appreciate God for what i have been able to acheive so far</br>
